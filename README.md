# DevOps & Infrastructure Portfolio

Welcome to my DevOps portfolio. This repository showcases a collection of automation scripts, infrastructure configurations, and software engineering projects developed during my intensive DevOps training. 

The focus of this repository is on **Automation**, **System Administration**, and **CI/CD best practices**.

---

## 🚀 Featured Project: AWS End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline
*Note: This project soon will be hosted in a separate repository for clarity.*
**a Link to its AWS Pipeline Repository will soon appear here.**
- **Tech Stack:** Jenkins, Docker, Maven, SonarQube, JFrog Artifactory.
- **Goal:** A fully automated pipeline that builds, tests, and packages a Java application into a Docker container, with automated quality gates.

## 🛠️ Portfolio Highlights

### 1. Infrastructure Automation (Python)
- **`ESXi-script.py`**: A specialized script for managing VMware ESXi virtual machines via SSH using the `Paramiko` library. Features YAML-based configuration for secure environment management.
- **`CloudMachine.py`**: An Object-Oriented approach to simulating and calculating cloud infrastructure costs based on different provider rates.

### 2. Linux Administration & Monitoring (Bash)
- **`logger.sh`**: A proactive system health monitor that tracks disk usage and logs warnings to `syslog` based on defined thresholds.
- **`services.sh`**: A utility for managing systemd services (start/stop/status) with a user-friendly CLI interface.
- **Advanced CLI Tools**: Scripts for clipboard integration, translation, and automated system interactions using `xdg-open` and `wl-clipboard`.

### 3. CI/CD & Containerization Concepts
- **`Dockerfile`**: Advanced multi-stage builds for Java applications, optimized for image size and security (non-root users).
- **`Jenkinsfile`**: Declarative pipeline syntax including static code analysis (SonarQube) and artifact versioning.

### 4. Software Engineering Fundamentals
- **Testing**: Implementation of Unit Tests using `pytest` for critical logic.
- **Data Parsing**: Automated conversion and filtering of CSV and JSON datasets, a key skill for log analysis and configuration management.
